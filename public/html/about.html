    <p class="about-below-p">
      The COVID-19 pandemic gave us a glimpse into the future of digital smart
      cities. Lockdowns and isolation made it imperative for everyone to operate
      virtually- be it school, business, or leisure. As the pandemic prevailed,
      we also got a window to assess the problems that existed in our cities.
      Delhi, for one, faced one of the harshest situations. Shortage of hospital
      beds, unavailability of vaccines, misinformation, scarcity of water,
      inequitable distribution of resources, and inefficient public transport
      and water supply being some of many. Desperate cries for medical supplies
      and help were seen all over social media for months- which points to a
      much bigger and scarier aspect of not only our healthcare system, but our
      city's management altogether. Digital aid, namely social media, was
      arguably the most advantageous service in these times of crisis. This
      leads us to believe that the sudden prevalence of digital media, which
      further points to smart cities, may have come about due to necessity, but
      smart cities are definitely our answer to the many ubiquitous challenges
      that will continue to plague our cities- pandemic or not.
